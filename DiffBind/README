DiffBind: Differential binding analysis of ChIPSeq peak data

1. Introduction
DiffBind is an R package that is used for identifying sites that are differentially bound between two sample groups. 
It works primarily with sets of peak calls (‘peaksets’), which are sets of genomic intervals representing candidate protein binding sites for each sample. 
It includes functions that support the processing of peaksets, including overlapping and merging peak sets across an entire dataset, 
counting sequencing reads in overlapping intervals in peak sets, and identifying statistically significantly differentially bound sites 
based on evidence of binding affinity (measured by differences in read densities).

5. Format of Input and Output
4.1 Input: .csv
This program requires csv file (sample sheet) that specifies your samples and their locations. The following columns are required:

SampleID,Tissue,Factor,Condition,Replicate,bamReads,bamControl,Peaks,PeakCaller

The first four columns are attributes for your samples that will be used to create a design matrix while the last four columns are for specifying file locations and type. The read files can be gzipped bed files or bam files.

4.2 Output: 
Significant differential peaks:

seqnames  ranges  strand  Conc Conc_Resistant Conc_Responsive      Fold   p-value       FDR

Conc: mean read concentration over all the samples (the default calculation uses log2 normalized ChIP read counts with control read counts subtracted)
Conc_Resistant: mean concentration over the first (Resistant) group
Conc_Responsive: mean concentration over the second (Responsive) group
Fold: shows the difference in mean concentrations between the two groups, with a positive value indicating increased binding affinity in the Resistant group and a negative value indicating increased binding affinity in the Responsive group.
