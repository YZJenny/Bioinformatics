DiffBind: Differential binding analysis of ChIPSeq peak data
1. Introduction
DiffBind provides functions for processing ChIP-Seq data enriched for genomic loci where specific protein/DNA binding occurs, including 
peak sets identified by ChIP-Seq peak callers and aligned sequence read datasets. It is designed to work with multiple peak sets simultaneously, 
representing different ChIP experiments (antibodies, transcription factor and/or histone marks, experimental conditions, replicates) as 
well as managing the results of multiple peak callers.
The primary emphasis of the package is on identifying sites that are differentially bound between two sample groups. It includes functions 
to support the processing of peak sets, including overlapping and merging peak sets, counting sequencing reads overlapping intervals in 
peak sets, and identifying statistically significantly differentially bound sites based on evidence of binding affinity (measured by differences in read densities). 
To this end it uses statistical routines developed in an RNA-Seq context (primarily the Bioconductor packages edgeR and DESeq2 ). 
Additionally, the package builds on Rgraphics routines to provide a set of standardized plots to aid in binding analysis.
