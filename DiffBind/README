DiffBind: Differential binding analysis of ChIPSeq peak data

1. Introduction
DiffBind is an R package that is used for identifying sites that are differentially bound between two sample groups. 
It works primarily with sets of peak calls (‘peaksets’), which are sets of genomic intervals representing candidate protein binding sites for each sample. 
It includes functions that support the processing of peaksets, including overlapping and merging peak sets across an entire dataset, 
counting sequencing reads in overlapping intervals in peak sets, and identifying statistically significantly differentially bound sites 
based on evidence of binding affinity (measured by differences in read densities).
