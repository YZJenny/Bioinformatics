DiffBind: Differential binding analysis of ChIPSeq peak data

1. Introduction
DiffBind provides functions for processing ChIP-Seq data enriched for genomic loci where specific protein/DNA binding occurs, including 
peak sets identified by ChIP-Seq peak callers and aligned sequence read datasets.
The primary emphasis of the package is on identifying sites that are differentially bound between two sample groups. 
To this end it uses statistical routines developed in an RNA-Seq context (primarily the Bioconductor packages edgeR and DESeq2 ).
