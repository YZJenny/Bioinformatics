DiffBind: Differential binding analysis of ChIPSeq peak data

1. Introduction
DiffBind works primarily with peaksets, which are sets of genomic intervals representing candidate protein binding sites. 
Each interval consists of a chromosome, a start and end position, and usually a score of some type indicating confidence in, or strength of,
the peak. Associated with each peakset are metadata relating to the experiment from which the peakset was derived.
