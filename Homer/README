HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) is a suite of tools for Motif Discovery and next-gen sequencing analysis.
HOMER was primarily written as a de novo motif discovery algorithm and is well suited for finding 8-20 bp motifs in large scale genomics data.  
HOMER contains many useful tools for analyzing ChIP-Seq, GRO-Seq, RNA-Seq, DNase-Seq, Hi-C and numerous other types of functional genomics sequencing data sets.

2.DNA motif的查找使用方法
(1) Next-Gen Sequencing/Genomic Position Analysis:
findMotifsGenome.pl: Program will find de novo and known motifs in regions in the genome

Usage: findMotifsGenome.pl <pos file> <genome> <output directory> [additional options]

Example:
awk '{print $4"\t"$1"\t"$2"\t"$3"\t+"}' input/H3K27me3_peaks.broadPeak > input/H3K27me3_peaks_homer.bed
findMotifsGenome.pl input/H3K27me3_peaks_homer.bed hg19 output/motifDir -len 8,10,12

(2) Gene/Promoter-based Analysis:
findMotifs.pl: Program will find de novo and known motifs in a gene list  

Usage:  findMotifs.pl <input list> <promoter set> <output directory> [additoinal options]

Example: findMotifs.pl input/genelist.txt human output/motifResults/ -len 8,10,12
