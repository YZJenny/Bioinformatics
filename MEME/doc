1.Motif Discovery
1.1 MEME: discovers novel, ungapped motifs in your sequences. 

1.2 DREME: discovers short, ungapped motifs that are relatively enriched in your sequences compared with shuffled sequences or your control sequences

1.3 MEME-ChIP: performs comprehensive motif analysis (including motif discovery) on LARGE sets of sequences (typically nucleotide) such as
those identifyed by CHIP-seq and CLIP-seq experiemnts

1.4 GLAM2: discovers novel, gapped motifs in your DNA or protein sequences

1.5 MoMo: discovers sequence motifs associated with different types of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) (sample output). 
The program takes as input a collection of PTMs identified using protein mass spectrometry. For each distinct type of PTM,
MoMo uses one of three algorithms to discover motifs representing amino acid preferences flanking the modification site.
